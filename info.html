            Sudoku is a logic base, combinatorial number place puzzle game. The objective of this game is to fill out a 9 X 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain  all the digits from 1 to 9. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

        </p>

        <p class = "blocktext">
            In each game, the player is provided with a partially completed grid. Each puzzle should only have one 
            correct solution.

        <h2>History of Sudoku</h2>
        <p class = "blocktext">
            Number puzzles similar to Sudoku first appeared in print in the late 19th century when
            French puzzle setters began expermenting with magic squares. However, they largely disappeared from publications by World War I. The modern iteration of Sudoku was most likely created by a retired architect in Indiana in the 1970s. It would later be introducted to Japan by a paper called the Montly Nikolist in the 1980s. Sudoku quickly gained popularity in Japan, but it would take another 
            20 years for this game to become popular in the West.
